DOM Node: This is the tag that you are looking up ie: ul.
document.querySelector(#theID):returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors. If no matches are found, null is returned.
To change text on page use textContent = ''

To add a class in the DOM use DOM node.classList.add('class-1')
Variables inside for loops are global variabes

Functions:
    Closures
    Scopes
    Variables

You can only see variabes that are inside a Function

EX: Cant do this:
    Function doSomething() {
        doSomething2();
    }

    Function doS\2() {
        var two = 2;
    }

Scope: Wher you can access the variablef from
Undefined: Value has not been assigned


var addNumber = function(num1,num2) {
    var sum = num1+num2
    return answer;
}

var doMath = function(operation) {
    var answer = operation(5,5);
    return answer;
};
doMath(addNumber);


function abc() {return true}: 
    Function decloration Reads the code then runs the function. This hoists the function to the top of the file.

var newFunc = function() {};
    This is a function expression. Runs and can be executed from top to bottom.

To create global variable use window.variableName = ...;

tyOf: safe way to check if a variabe exists or not.

Closures: Creates a new empty scope inside a for loops

(function() {
    ...
})(); 
    'This will create a local scope for the variabes in the function. this means that the data will not be destroyed in every itiration of the loop. The information is saved and reused'

async function: 
    A function that runs imidiately, but it does not return right away. The function waits for the information to be recieved.

    assertassert( ( falsefalse, , "Uh, this isn't good! Where'd ninja.yell go?""Uh, this isn't good! Where'd ninja.yell go?" );  ); 

 'Assert ninja.yell. This will pass because its already defined. Once we get to the second assert; it fails because we now set ninja as Null;therefore, there is no value inside it. Its empty.'

var ninja = { 
  yell: function yell(n){ 
    return n > 0 ? yell(n-1) + "a" : "hiy"; 
  } 
}; 
assert( ninja.yell(4) == "hiyaaaa", "Works as we would expect it to!" ); 
 
var samurai = { yell: ninja.yell }; 
var ninja = {}; 
assert( samurai.yell(4) == "hiyaaaa", "The method correctly calls itself." );

'This means that the variable samuri will call the function yell from ninja. Even though ninja is reassigned an empty value; it was already called and the value from it will be returned as true in the assert.'
